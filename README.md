# MySql
This assignment explores the EER (Enchanced-Entity Relationship) diagram- primary key and foreign keys.
MySQL uses Structured Query Language to manage data inside a database. 
With this store database assignment, I was able to create functions to extract data from my chosen database and visually see the relationships across different tables using the EER diagram.
